# Counter Strike: Source - Decompiled assets

A small repository of decompiled "Counter Strike: Source" files, and yes, this is the Steam version (v90 if I'm not mistaken).

I really don't know if it's useful to anyone, I'm just putting it up because I'm a bit messy. I just upload the thing that i'm going to use, but if anyone wants I'll try to decompile the remaining files.
